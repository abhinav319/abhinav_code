There was a tiger. He was very cruel in his youth. He was a man-eater. In his old age, he became very weak. He could no longer hunt down any animal. So he suffered much for want of food. ad a gold bangle in his possession. He sat in an open place in the forest with that bangle.

There was a road along with that open place. When the tiger saw any man passing by he said to him, “Brother, here is a good bangle. I wish to give it to you. Don’t fear. lam old and infirm now. I now pray to God five times a day and doing it will be useful to you. Don’t fear, come to me and take other religious acts. This bangle is useless to me. It will be useful to you. Don’t fear, come to me and take this.”
